## pro's

1. build in live browser view is great! if you work on css it even highlight the the tag your working on. 

2. it's a free open source program that's also *cross platform*.

3. Brackets is being actively maintained and developed.


## cons

+ the live browser view only works with **chrome**.

+ since brackets is an open source software, it is always inproving. so if you feel like there is lacking something after a while it will probably be added in a software update.

+ it would be nice if brackets had a sharing function. so you could easy share your code between users so they could help you work on you projects. but hey there you got github for! :grimacing:

## why do i use it? 

> that's very easy. i use it because i know it. i learned this in school and just kept using it  and it has never failed me. well didn't do much more then HTML and CSS so i might find some  >  difficulties when i have to use it for heavier things. 

uuu
