# brackets
### [downoad link](http://brackets.io/)



## pro's

1. build in live browser view is great! if you work on css it even highlight the the tag your working on. 

2. it's a free open source program that's also cross platform.

3. Brackets is being actively maintained and developed.


## cons

1. the live browser view only works with _chrome_.

2. since brackets is an open source software, it is always inproving. so if you feel like there is lacking something after a while it will probably be added in a software update.

3. it would be nice if brackets had a sharing function. so you could easy share your code between users so they could help you work on you projects. but hey that's what github is for!

## why do i use it? 

that's very easy. i use it because i know it. i learned this in school and just kept using it and it has never failed me. well didn't do much more then HTML and CSS so i might find some difficulties when i have to use it for heavier things.
